  - Removed SupabaseUserService imports and usage
  - Cleaned up merge conflicts
  - Standardized to use Sequelize models only

- **Updated `Backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js`**
  - Removed Supabase API-only mode logic
  - Simplified authentication flow to use Sequelize only

### ✅ Services Cleanup
- **Removed Supabase service files:**
  - `Backend/services/supabaseService.js`
  - `Backend/services/supabaseUserService.js`

### ✅ Package Dependencies
- **Updated `Backend/package.json`**
  - Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency
  - Cleaned up Supabase-related npm scripts
  - Maintained all other dependencies (pg, sequelize, etc.)

- **Updated `Frontend/package.json`**
  - Removed Supabase dependencies and merge conflicts
  - Clean Vite + React configuration

### ✅ Documentation
- **Updated `README.md`**
  - Changed database section from Supabase to Railway
  - Updated environment variable examples
  - Modified deployment instructions

- **Created `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`**
  - Comprehensive guide for deploying to Railway
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Frontend deployment options
  - Troubleshooting tips

- **Created `Backend/.env.railway`**
  - Example environment file for Railway deployment
  - Includes all necessary variables and comments

## How to Use Railway

### 1. Development Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd Backend
npm install
cp .env.railway .env
# Edit .env with your Railway database credentials
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Railway Deployment
1. Create Railway project at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Add PostgreSQL service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set environment variables as per `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
5. Deploy!

## Environment Variables

### Railway Automatically Provides:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Complete PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE` - Individual connection parameters

### You Need to Set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key`
- `SMTP_*` variables (if using email features)

## Key Benefits of Railway Migration

1. **Simplified Configuration**: No more dual database systems or API-only modes
2. **Better PostgreSQL Support**: Direct connection with standard connection strings
3. **Easier Deployment**: Railway handles database provisioning automatically
4. **Cost Effective**: Railway's pricing is competitive for small to medium applications
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Integrated logging, metrics, and deployment pipeline

## Testing the Migration

After setup, test the connection:
```bash
cd Backend
npm run db:test
```

This should show: `✅ DB Connected!`

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If you need to go back to Supabase:
1. Restore the original `config/database.js` from git history
2. Add `@supabase/supabase-js` back to package.json
3. Set `USE_SUPABASE_API_ONLY=true` in environment variables

The migration maintains backward compatibility with the existing database schema and models.
